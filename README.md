This design has the following features:
- Clock Divider (/1, /2, /4, /8, /16, /32, /64)
- 4 Registers which control the PRN.
  - Address 0: Address of register to configure
  - Address 1: Clock Divider (bits 0-2, rest don't care)
  - Address 2: Bits to enable
    - This allows for any number of bits, from PRN 2 up to PRN 16.
  - Address 3: Polynomial
    - The value in this register is the polynomial for the PRN.
- SPI Interface
  - CLK, MOSI, CS
  - First chip select down gives the address of the next register write.
  - Second chip select down gives the data for the register.
  - Address storage resets after second chip select up.
    - There is no safety mechanism for if the SPI gets out of sync...
- Reset_N
- PRN sequence generator.
- Has a fail safe all 0's check to ensure the PRN generator does not get locked up.
